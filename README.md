# DummyImageCreator

note* generator is very hacky right now. This was written quickly and speed was a huge priority.

A high level GUI and CLI tool for creating dummy memory images.
Outputs in binary format. Basic srecord 1.64 integration allows for easy intel and motorola formats.
Includes memory offset optimizations.

Program saves settings as individual files which allows for nearly unlimited memory image storage as well as the ability to quickly share memory images.
